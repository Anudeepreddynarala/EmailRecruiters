## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd EmailRecruiters
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure API keys

The project uses:
- **Jina AI** for web scraping and HTML parsing
- **Google Gemini** for AI-powered role analysis
- **Apollo.io** (optional) for finding actual contacts at companies

API keys are configured in the `.env` file. The Apollo.io integration is optional - you can still use the tool without it for job analysis and role suggestions.

## Usage

### Analyze a Job Posting

Use the `analyze` command to fetch and analyze a job posting:

```bash
./run_cli.sh analyze <job_url>
```

**Example:**

```bash
./run_cli.sh analyze https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/123456789
```

This will:
1. Fetch the job posting using Jina AI
2. Extract key information (title, company, location, domain, description)
3. Analyze the job with Gemini to suggest relevant contacts
4. Display prioritized list of roles to reach out to
5. Provide search tips with company domain for Apollo/LinkedIn
6. Save the analysis to the database

### Output Format

The tool provides:
- **Job Information**: Title, company, location, domain, LinkedIn URL
- **Suggested Contacts**: Prioritized list (1-7) of roles to contact
- **Search Keywords**: Keywords to use when searching for these roles on LinkedIn/Apollo

### Options

- `--no-save`: Don't save the analysis to the database
- `--format json`: Output results in JSON format instead of text
- `--search-apollo`: Automatically search for contacts on Apollo.io
- `--max-contacts-per-role N`: Maximum contacts to find per role (default: 3)
- `--enrich-emails N`: Number of top contacts to enrich/unlock emails (default: 5)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic analysis without Apollo.io
./run_cli.sh analyze https://example.com/job

# Analysis with Apollo.io contact search (emails enriched automatically for top 5)
./run_cli.sh analyze https://example.com/job --search-apollo

# Search with custom enrichment (unlock top 3 emails)
./run_cli.sh analyze https://example.com/job --search-apollo --enrich-emails 3

# No email enrichment (save credits)
./run_cli.sh analyze https://example.com/job --search-apollo --enrich-emails 0

# JSON output, no save, with Apollo.io search
./run_cli.sh analyze https://example.com/job --format json --no-save --search-apollo
```

**Email Enrichment:**

By default, when using `--search-apollo`, the tool automatically enriches the top 5 most relevant contacts to unlock their real email addresses. This:
- Prioritizes contacts based on role relevance (e.g., hiring managers first)
- Saves API credits by only enriching the most important contacts
- Gives you actionable email addresses to start your outreach immediately

### Search for Contacts

Use the `search-contacts` command to find contacts on Apollo.io:

**Search by saved job ID:**

```bash
./run_cli.sh search-contacts --job-id 1
```

**Manual search by domain and titles:**

```bash
./run_cli.sh search-contacts --domain acmecorp.com --title "Engineering Manager" --title "VP Engineering"
```

**Search and save contacts to database:**

```bash
./run_cli.sh search-contacts --job-id 1 --save
```

**Control email enrichment:**

```bash
# Enrich top 3 contacts only
./run_cli.sh search-contacts --job-id 1 --enrich-emails 3

# No email enrichment
./run_cli.sh search-contacts --domain acmecorp.com --title "Director" --enrich-emails 0
```

This will:
1. Search Apollo.io for people matching the suggested roles
2. Enrich top N contacts to unlock real email addresses (default: 5)
3. Display contact information (name, title, email, LinkedIn)
4. Optionally save contacts to the database for tracking

### Add Contacts to Sequences

Automatically add found contacts to Apollo.io email sequences for automated outreach campaigns.

**List available sequences:**

```bash
./run_cli.sh list-sequences
```

**Add contacts to a sequence during analysis:**

```bash
./run_cli.sh analyze <job_url> --search-apollo --add-to-sequence "Test auto sequencing"
```

**IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTES:**
- This ONLY adds contacts to the sequence (staging them)
- It does NOT automatically start the campaign
- You must manually review and start the sequence in Apollo.io UI
- Requires a **master API key** (not regular API key)
- Requires email account configuration in the sequence

**Setup Requirements:**
1. Create a master API key in Apollo.io (Settings -> API)
2. Create your sequence in Apollo.io web interface
3. Configure a sending email account for the sequence
4. Run the analyze command with `--add-to-sequence` flag

This ensures you can review contacts before starting any outreach campaign.

### Testing Sequences with Test Emails

You can test your sequence configuration without using real Apollo.io search results or consuming search credits.

**Create test contacts and add to sequence:**

```bash
./run_cli.sh analyze <job_url> \
  --test-emails "email1@test.com,email2@test.com,email3@test.com" \
  --add-to-sequence "Test" \
  --no-confirm
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates test contacts in Apollo.io with the provided emails
2. Each contact gets a person_id from Apollo.io
3. Contacts are added to the specified sequence
4. You can verify the sequence configuration works correctly

**Use cases:**
- Testing sequence setup before using real contacts
- Verifying email account configuration
- Checking custom field updates
- Testing sequence timing and templates

**Example:**

```bash
./run_cli.sh analyze https://example.com/job \
  --test-emails "anudeep@test.com,john@test.com" \
  --add-to-sequence "Test auto sequencing" \
  --no-save
```

**Note:** Test contacts are real contacts in Apollo.io. You may want to delete them after testing or use a dedicated test organization.

### Email Personalization

EmailRecruiters automatically personalizes your emails by setting custom fields for each contact.

**What gets personalized:**
- Contact's first name ({{first_name}})
- Job title they're applying for ({{custom.applied_role}})

**One-Time Setup:**

1. Create a custom field in Apollo.io:
   - Go to Settings → Custom Fields
   - Create Contact Custom Field
   - Name: `Applied Role`
   - Type: Text

2. Use in your sequence template:
   ```
   Hi {{first_name}},

   I noticed you're hiring for a {{custom.applied_role}} at {{company}}.

   I'm very interested in this {{custom.applied_role}} opportunity...
   ```

**How it works:**

When you add contacts to a sequence, the tool automatically:
1. Extracts the job title from the posting (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer")
2. Updates each contact's "Applied Role" custom field with that title
3. Shows you the personalization variables to use

**Example:**
```bash
./run_cli.sh analyze <job_url> --search-apollo --add-to-sequence "Sequence Name"
```

Output will include:
```
✓ Updated 15/15 contacts with job title: 'Senior Software Engineer'
  (You can now use {{first_name}} and {{custom.applied_role}} in your sequence emails)

Email personalization:
  - Use {{first_name}} for the contact's first name
  - Use {{custom.applied_role}} for the job title: 'Senior Software Engineer'
```

📖 **See [PERSONALIZATION.md](PERSONALIZATION.md) for complete guide with examples**

### Batch Processing Multiple Jobs

Process multiple job URLs automatically and add all contacts to your sequence:

**Method 1: Using the batch script**

```bash
./batch_process_jobs.sh "Test auto sequencing" \
  https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/company1/job1 \
  https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/company2/job2 \
  https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/company3/job3
```

**Method 2: Manual batch with --no-confirm flag**

```bash
# Process multiple URLs without confirmation prompts
./run_cli.sh analyze <job_url_1> --search-apollo --add-to-sequence "Test auto sequencing" --no-confirm
./run_cli.sh analyze <job_url_2> --search-apollo --add-to-sequence "Test auto sequencing" --no-confirm
./run_cli.sh analyze <job_url_3> --search-apollo --add-to-sequence "Test auto sequencing" --no-confirm
```

**Method 3: Process from a file**

Create a file `job_urls.txt` with one URL per line, then:

```bash
# Read URLs from file and process each one
while IFS= read -r url; do
  [[ "$url" =~ ^#.*$ ]] && continue  # Skip comments
  [[ -z "$url" ]] && continue         # Skip empty lines
  ./run_cli.sh analyze "$url" --search-apollo --add-to-sequence "Test auto sequencing" --no-confirm
done < job_urls.txt
```

**Workflow:**
1. Configure your sequence once in Apollo.io (email account, timing, templates)
2. Run the batch processing with all your job URLs
3. All contacts automatically added to the sequence
4. Go to Apollo.io, review all contacts in one place
5. Manually start the sequence when ready
